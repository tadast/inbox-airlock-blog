Sometimes, all it takes is a gentle nudge and a little bit less friction.

Weâ€™re excited to introduce Unsubscribe Suggestions to some of our Inbox Airlock users. We will be rolling this out gradually to everyone throughout the next month.

Keeping your inbox tidy is crucial not only for your productivity and reducing the storage space required in your Gmail. It also improves how you feel about your email. While Inbox Airlock already filters out the fluff, maintaining overall tidiness in your secondary inbox folder that we call "Airlock" reduces cognitive load significantly and makes your overall inbox experience so much smoother.

An infrequent nudge and a one-click bulk unsubscribe is all it takes to fall back in love with your inbox.

Inbox Airlock scans your newsletters and reminds you to unsubscribe from the ones you don't read. Then allows you to unsubscribe from all at once or bulk unsubscribe from selected newsletters.

Try it out on [Inbox Airlock](https://www.inboxairlock.com?utm_source=blog-unsub) today.
