Spam filters do a good job filtering out obvious spam, yet professional inboxes are often plagued by automated cold sales emails that get through them. Surprisingly, it's mostly an unsolved problem. Here's 2 approaches to tackle it on Gmail.

# Approach 1: Labels and Filters

This is a free albeit limited solution, as it does not automatically catch all cold outreach.

## Step 1: Define Keywords and Phrases

Identify keywords or phrases common in cold outreach emails. This could include terms like “introducing,” “opportunity,” “business,” “collaboration,” or specific phrases like “just following up” or “reaching out.”

Step 2: Set Up Filters in Gmail

	1.	Open Gmail, click the settings gear icon, then select See all settings.
	2.	Go to the Filters and Blocked Addresses tab and click Create a new filter.
	3.	In the "Has the words" field, add your chosen keywords or phrases, separated by `OR` (e.g., `introducing OR opportunity OR "just following up"`).
	4.	Click Create filter with this search, and in the next menu, check Apply the label.
	5.	Choose an existing label or create a new one, such as “Cold Outreach.”
	6.	Save by clicking Create filter.

Step 3: Adjust as Needed

As you encounter new types of outreach emails, add relevant keywords to your filter to improve its effectiveness. You can edit the filter under Filters and Blocked Addresses anytime.

Step 4: Automatically archive Cold Outreach

Observe how the filters perform

# Approach 2: Use a dedicated tool

To get full control of cold outreach, you can use a Gmail add-on built for this purpose such as [Inbox Airlock](https://www.inboxairlock.com). Inbox Airlock works out of the box and detects cold outreach cross-checking if the sender is someone you've corresponded with before. [It is not free](https://www.inboxairlock.com/airlock/start#pricing), but surprisingly effective for the price and comes with other useful features to increase your productivity.
